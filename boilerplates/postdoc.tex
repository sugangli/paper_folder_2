{\bf \large{Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan}} 
\end{center}


We have budgeted for one postdoctoral position. 
Our goal for the postdoctoral researcher mentoring program is to
provide exposure to a multi-disciplinary research program as well as
prepare the postdoctoral researcher for excelling in his/her chosen
career path.  To accomplish this goal, the mentoring plan will follow
the guidance of the National Postdoctoral
Association.\footnote{{http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/policy/institutional-policies/}} In
particular, we highlight following components:

\vspace{+2mm}

{\bf Multi-disciplinary training:}~~Our proposed research is in
  the intersection of systems, architecture, and security. The PIs are fully
  committed to training the postdoctoral researchers to be an expert in
  these areas. These efforts include regular, intense intellectual interactions
 between the researcher and the PIs in all areas, especially those
  where the researcher would like to particularly enhance his/her
  background and expertise. 
  Thus, the postdoctoral researcher will
  have ample opportunities to access both educational and research
  activities offered by the PIs.

{\bf Support growth in professional network:}~~Having access to a
  large professional community is crucial to a researcher's career. To
  this end, we have budgeted adequate travel support for the
  postdoctoral researcher, so that he/she can attend important
  conferences in appropriate areas as well as visit other
  institutions to disseminate research results. The PIs will also
  encourage collaboration between the postdoctoral researcher and
  research communities  as
  well as the industry. The PIs will also designate certain research
  related administrative responsibilities, such as inviting and
  hosting well-known researchers, to increase the postdoctoral
  researcher's visibility and exposure to a larger professional
  network.

{\bf Academic career preparation:}~~Preparing entry into the academic
  career path can be a challenging, painstaking, and sometimes
  confusing process. The PIs are committed to guiding the postdoctoral
  researchers in every phase and aspect of that process. The PIs
 have been on
  several faculty recruiting committees.  
  Our specific initiatives for enhancing the postdoctoral researcher's
  academic profile include integration into teaching (through guest
  lecturing, for instance), co-advising of Ph.D. students,
  participation in grant proposal and interview preparation.
  
  \vspace{+2mm}
{\bf Quality control and monitoring:}~~The PIs will assess the success
  of the mentoring plan by tracking the postdoctoral researcher's
  progress, according to an initially established plan and subsequent
  progress towards his/her chosen career path.
  
  
\vspace{+2mm}
{\bf Outreach and diversity activities:}~~We will make a
  significant effort to attract and recruit participation from
  traditionally underrepresented minorities in engineering, and
  particularly women. We will encourage the postdoctoral researcher 
  to participate in the outreach activities outlined in the project description
  and in particular be an informal mentor for students from underrepresented populations.
