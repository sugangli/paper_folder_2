\section{Results from Prior NSF Supports\label{sec:prior}}

Both PIs Zhang and Zhong have received multiple NSF grants in the past five years. The most related to the proposed projects, one for each PI, are: 



In a NeTS Small project, \emph{LAWN: Scaling Up Cellular Data Networks
  using a Large Number of Antennas}, CNS-1218700 (2012-15). {\bf Intellectual Merit:}~~PI Zhong
investigate
network architecture issues in applying massive MU-MIMO to cellular
networks. This project produced the Argos 64-antenna MU-MIMO base station~\cite{shepard2012mobicom} and provided the early
results that motivate some of the proposed research activities~\cite{shepard2013cellnet}. {\bf Broader Impact:} Argos was the largest many-antenna MU-MIMO base station prototype publicly known at its publication~\cite{shepard2012mobicom}. It influenced Samsung's development of its own 32-antenna MU-MIMO base station prototype~\cite{samsung2013fdmimo} and recent 3GPP's approval of a proposal to study massive MIMO for LTE~\cite{fdmimo}. %s
