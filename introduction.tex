\vspace{4pt}\noindent\textbf{Disaster Management:} Efficient disaster management is of critical importance in today's world. 

\vspace{4pt}\noindent\textbf{Shortcomings with Existing Solutions:} Existing solutions are insufficient for the following reasons. 

\vspace{4pt}\noindent\textbf{Tomography-Based Diaster Management with Many-Antenna Receivers:} In this proposal, we propose to design and develop a diaster management cyber-physical system (CPS) using tomography that is supported by many-antenna receivers.  

\vspace{4pt}\noindent\textbf{Intellectual Merit:} In order to support a vision of conducting deep tomography-based disaster management using many-antenna receivers, the proposed effort presents a collaborative effort between a team at the Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB) at Rutgers University, and a team at Rice University to engage in a systems design and integration effort. The Rutgers team will lead the effort in protocol design and initial evaluation, while the Rice team will lead the effort in prototyping and testbed evaluation. We refer to the proposed tomography-based disaster management cyber-physical system as \emph{TomoMan} in this proposal. TomoMan has the following integral components: ***
